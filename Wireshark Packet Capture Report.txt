Wireshark Packet Capture Report

1. Task Performed

1. Installed Wireshark on the system.


2. Started capturing packets on the active network interface (eth0).


3. Generated traffic by browsing a website and connecting to external servers.


4. Stopped the capture after around one minute.


5. Applied protocol filters (TCP, ARP, NTP, ICMP, TLS).


6. Identified multiple different protocols within the capture.

2. Captured Protocols

From the captured data (as shown in the screenshots), at least three different protocols were observed:

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Example: Connection attempts between local host 192.168.235.141 and remote IPs (34.107.243.93, 65.61.137.117).

Packets included handshakes, ACKs, RST/FIN flags, and HTTP/TLS traffic.



2. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Example: Broadcast queries like “Who has 192.168.235.27? Tell 192.168.235.141” and replies.

This shows local device discovery on the LAN.



3. NTP (Network Time Protocol)

Example: Communication between 192.168.235.141 and 95.216.144.226.

Used for time synchronization with an external server.




Additionally, ICMP (Router Solicitation) and TLSv1.2 (Application Data) packets were also present.

3. Observations

TCP traffic:

Connections to remote web servers (port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).

Handshakes and reset/termination packets observed, meaning multiple connection attempts and session closures.


ARP traffic:

Normal broadcast traffic inside the virtual/local network environment.

Indicates the machine resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses.


NTP traffic:

Time synchronization queries from the local system to external time servers.


ICMP traffic:

Router solicitation packet broadcasted to discover gateway/router presence.


TLS traffic:

Encrypted HTTPS session packets exchanged with external servers.

4. Conclusion

The Wireshark capture shows normal network activity consisting of:

Local ARP discovery,

TCP handshakes with remote servers,

NTP synchronization, and

Secure TLS web traffic.


At least three distinct protocols (TCP, ARP, NTP) were clearly identified, fulfilling the task requirements. No suspicious or abnormal packets were detected in the captured timeframe.
